# Bunden Foruds√¶tning - Game Development

Welcome to the start of my 3D world.
The game is far from done, and will continue to develop on it as time goes.

I must admit that I underestimated how long it would take for me to create an entire 3D world from tutorials.
But i'm still quite happy that I at least have a world going, where in I can generate random terrain, objects, player model along with camera and player movement.

The game it self have been made with <b>[LWJGL](https://www.lwjgl.org/)</b> <br />
Extra utility: <b>[Slick](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?redir_token=VxeQj5i_7jjXQb_YsMGY3sjALnV8MTUxOTgzNzI0MEAxNTE5NzUwODQw&event=video_description&v=Jdkq-aSFEA0&q=http%3A%2F%2Fslick.ninjacave.com%2Fslick-util.jar)</b>

<b> What is LWJGL?</b>
LWJGL is a Java library that enables cross-platform access to popular native APIs useful in the development of graphics (OpenGL), audio (OpenAL) and parallel computing (OpenCL) applications. 
This access is direct and high-performance, yet also wrapped in a type-safe and user-friendly layer, appropriate for the Java ecosystem.
